                <p>
                    William Forsythe (born December 30, 1949) is an American dancer and choreographer formerly resident
                    in
                    Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and now based in Vermont. He is known for his work with the Ballet
                    Frankfurt
                    (1984-2004) and The Forsythe Company (2005-2015).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognized for the integration of ballet and visual arts, which displayed both abstraction and
                    forceful
                    theatricality, his vision of choreography as an organizational practice has inspired him to produce
                    numerous
                    installations, films, and web-based knowledge creation, incorporating the spoken word and
                    experimental
                    music.

            <h2>The Choreographic Style of Forsythe</h2>
            <section class="flex-container">
                <p class="flex-item-left">
                    Forsythe believes that classical ballet is a language with rules to follow. However, although he is
                    trained with these rules, he is much more interested in bending and eventually breaking these
                    guidelines.
                </p>
                <p class="flex-item-middle">
                    His style is based on classical ballet, using traditional positions, but developing them to the
                    extreme.
                    Many of his pieces are danced on pointe, but he has used all kind of footwear, including work-boots,
                    socks, and slippers, in order to explore different choreographic results.
                </p>
                <p class="flex-item-right">
                    Forsythe's choreographic style is both postmodern and deconstructivist. Similar to the style of
                    other
                    postmodernists, Forsythe plays with the unexpected, moments of improvisation, and he emphasizes
                    process
                    within the creation of his works. The extreme positions involved in his ballets require a great deal
                    of flexibility, and, in fact, most of his dancers possess that skill.
